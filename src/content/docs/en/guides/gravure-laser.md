This guide takes you step by step through the use of the laser engraver. It is mainly used for engraving materials by using a focused laser beam that creates surface markings depending on power and speed settings.

## Personal security

- Safety is critical when using the laser engraver. It is therefore mandatory to follow these rules:
  - Always wear protective glasses rated for laser
  - Never look directly at the laser beam without protective glasses
  - Never operate the laser engraver with the protective cover open
  - Ensure the ventilation system is running before starting any job
  - **NEVER leave the machine unattended** while operating as a fire could start and spread quickly
- Before using the laser engraver, locate the nearby **fire extinguisher**, **fire-retardant blanket** and **protective glasses**.

## Software workflow

To operate the laser engraver, we currently use **LaserWeb**, an open-source software designed to control laser cutters.

The laser engraving workflow consists of:
1. Preparing the design (vector or raster file)
2. Importing the design into LaserWeb
3. Verifying or resizing the dimensions of the design
4. Setting the engraving parameters
5. Generating the G-code for the machine
6. Executing the job
7. Safely shutting down the machine

## 1. Powering on the machine

The laser engraver has **multiple control switches located on different parts of the machine**.

- Front Panel Controls:
  ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_04.png)
  - **Main power switch** : this switch turn on the computer.
  - **Laser server switch** : This switch activate the laser machine control server. Use it only once the computer has fully booted.
- Top-Mounted Controls:
  ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_05.png)
  - An air assist compressor is located on the top right of the machine and used to provide a focused air stream to cool the material during engraving
    - Do not activate yet - we will turned it on before starting the job
- Inside enclosure
  ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_06.png)
  - The Laser enable switch is Located on the right inner wall of the enclosure and provides power to the laser diode module
    - Do not activate yet - we will turned it on before starting the job

## 2. Using LaserWeb software

- Open LaserWeb from the desktop shortcut

  ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_07.png)

- Import the design:
  - Click the "Add Document" button and select the design to use.
  ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_08.png)
    - Supported formats:
        - Vector (SVG): Best for logos, text, and line art
        - Raster (PNG, JPG): Best for photographs images
  - Once the design is added, you can visualize it on the page.
  ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_09.png)

- Adjust the design size
  - Select the design and look at the current dimensions of the imported design (in mm) in the properties panel. To resize it, simply select the design from the sidebar and enter the new dimensions in millimeters in the dialog box.
  ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_10.png)

- Adjust the position of the design in the workspace
  - Select the design and click on the top-right arrow icon to align the design with the machine origin
  ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_11_v2.png)

- Configure the engraving settings
    1. Then, select the design and drag and drop it into the **GCODE** section
      ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_12.png)
    2. Select amongst various operation type (In this example, we select **Laser Fill Path**):
      ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_13.png)
        - Laser Fill path: For filling solid areas (recommended for most engraving operations involving vector files)
        - Laser Raster Merge: For creating detailed grayscale images
        - Laser Cut Outside: For for cutting along the outer perimeter of designs in laser engraving, creating clean outlines around the engraved pattern
    3. Set the engraving parameters:
        - Line Distance (mm): Defines the spacing between engraving lines. Smaller spacing improves resolution but increases processing time (we usually set 0.2)
        - Laser Power (0-100%): adjusts laser intensity.
        - Passes: Specifies how many times the laser will trace over the same area
        - Cut Rate (in mm/s): Determines how fast the laser moves. Slower speeds create deeper engravings but may burn the material.
        ![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_14.png)
        
        :::note[Advice]
        The engraving parameters shown above are used to engrave a logo (SVG format) on plywood.
        Please note that each material may require unique engraving parameters.

![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_30.png)
![Illustration](../../../../assets/img/laser/laser_31.png)

- Allow material to cool before removing or handling them
- Turn off systems in reverse order:
    - Air compressor
    - Ventilation
    - Laser switch
    - Laser server
    - Main power

## 7. Maintenance

Although this module adopts an internal air-assisted design, long-term use may not prevent dust or a small amount of smoke from affecting the lens. It is recommended to clean the lens with a clean cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol. Dust or smoke may overheat the lens and cause the lens to burn out.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Laser going too slow** : Check that the **Speed unit** (speed at which the laser head move) in **mm/s or mm/min** is set appropriately for the values you have entered.
- **Uneven engraving depth** : Verify that the material surface is perfectly flat and check if the focal length is correctly set
- **Poor image quality** : Ensure proper file format (vector for text/logos, raster for photos) and verify resolution of the design
- **Machine not responding** : Check all power switches are on, Verify computer-machine connection, Restart LaserWeb software

## To go further

- Consider experimenting with other software options for operating the laser machine to explore additional features offered by laser engraving programs (e.g., LightBurn, LaserGRBL, etc.).
